## Project

> Write your own printf function.

## Welcome

This is a rebuild of the standard printf function in C. The printf functions, returns or sends a formatted string to the standard output.

## Description

This is a printf function with functionalities of printing characters, strings, octals, hexadecimals (x and X) and a custom binary format.
> - print1.c
is our file that contain printf function.
we created a file for each formatter. Formatter files:


Also, we created helper files to put universal helper functions. These functions are used multiple times throughout the files. Helper Files:

lastly, we have a manual for the 

>  - printf man_3_printf

## Built With

- [UBUNTU](https://ubuntu.com/).
- [GitHub](https://github-dotcom.gateway.web.tr/).

## Requirements


- Allowed editors:** vi**, **vim**,** emacs**
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file.
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h.
- Don’t forget to push your header file.
- All your header files should be include guarded.
- Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project.

=======
This team project is part of the ALX Curriculum. It is about printf implementation as it is similar to the c library

What we should learn from this project:

    How to use git in a team setting
    Applying variadic functions to a big project
    The complexities of printf
    Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow
